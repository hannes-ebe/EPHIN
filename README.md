# EPHIN_Loader
A simple loader for Level 3 PHA data for SOHO-EPHIN.

The EPHIN sensor (Electron Proton Helium INstrument) onboard the SOHO spacecraft
(SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory) is a detector to measure energy spectra. It can mea-
sure electrons with energies from 250 keV to > 8.7 MeV and hydrogen and helium isotopes
from 4 MeV/n up to > 53 MeV/n using a combination of solid state detectors.
